# My Personal Project - Sleep Pattern Tracker

## Project by Sharon Marfatia


**What my application will do:**
- My application will track a student's *sleep targets for the week in hours* and store data on their *sleep record
throughout the week in hours*. Using this information, the tracker will report their *sleep debt (hours of sleep 
targeted - actual hours of sleep)* or *sleep surplus*. Additional console-based questions will be asked from the user 
on whether they had *exams during the week or not* to compare how exams may or may not have affected the student's sleep 
time. This information can be shown through graphical representation (e.g., bar graph).

**Who will use it:**
- This application is intended for high school, undergraduate, or graduate students trying to improve their sleep 
patterns so that they can balance their studies and a healthy lifestyle. The Sleep Pattern Tracker will provide an 
honest representation of the amount of sleep you get in the week depending on the weekday and whether you are studying
for your exams on a time crunch.

**Why this project is of interest to me:**
- As a university student, I often suffer from a lack of sleep on an irregular pattern during exam periods.
Managing exam preparations while completing assignments and textbook readings requires more time commitment towards
studying, which can heavily reduce your sleep intake. Additionally, you often turn a blind eye to how much sleep you 
actually accumulated throughout the week. This application gives you a clear understanding of how your sleep pattern is 
looking so that you can direct yourself to change your habits for a healthier lifestyle. I see myself using an app like 
this, and so with this Sleep Pattern Tracker, I also want other students to benefit from a healthier approach to their 
daily sleep patterns.

*User Stories*

- As a user, I want to add the object (my day and night record of sleep - X) to my weekly sleep log class - Y so that I
get an array of objects (daily sleep pattern records) in the weekly sleep log class.


- As a user, I want to be able to view the list of daily sleep hours in my weekly sleep log class.


- As a user, I want to be able to edit a sleep log entry from my weekly sleep log.


- As a user, I want to be able to remove a sleep log entry from my weekly sleep log.

P2 user stories:

- As a user, I want to save the entire state of my weekly sleep log to file. 

- As a user, I want to reload the state from file and continue where I had started on my weekly sleep log entry.
